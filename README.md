Open source of App Inventor Extensions By PeterZhong



You can compile the extension with the [extension-builder](https://github.com/ColinTree/extension-builder) by ColinTree. Visit the website and input the information(including the path of the folder[Note: not the path of the Java file]),then click `build with Github` and wait. You'll get an extension file easily in less than 5 minutes.



Of course you can compile the extension locally. See more about this at App Inventor's website.



It's welcome for you to be a contributor for my extensions, and of course you can use my source code in different ways, but you can not use my source code to earn money. Thanks!
